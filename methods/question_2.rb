#State what each expression evaluates to/returns


1. x = 2
#return value of 2

2. puts x = 2
#return value of nil - as will always be the case with puts statements

3. p name = "Joe"
#return value of "Joe" - p will output and return the variable argument

4. four = "four"
#return value of "four"

5. print something = "nothing"
#return value of nil - as will always be the case with print statements
